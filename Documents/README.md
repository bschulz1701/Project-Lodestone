## Papers:
##### [_Improving a Geophone to Produce an Affordable, Broadband Seismometer_](ImprovingGeophone_Slides_Barzilai_2000.pdf)
Slides from the corresponding thesis work, describing the development of a capacitive displacement measurement geophone, describes a novel resolution measurement method, describes limitations and simulations of conventional amplification electronics for conventional geophones 

##### [_Frequency Limits For Seismometers As Determined From Signal-To-Noise Ratios. Part 1. The Electromagnetic Seismometer_](FreqLimitsSeismo_Rodgers_1992.pdf)
This paper discusses and analyses the limitations and system response of the conventional geophone/seismometer 

##### [_Limits of Sensitivity of Inertial Seismometers with Velocity Transducers and Electronic Amplifiers_](LimitsOfSensitivity_Riedesel_1990.pdf)
**Riedesel, Mark A., Moore, Robert D., Orcutt, John A.**

This paper discussed in detail the sources of limitations of seismometers (internal, external noise), as well as ways to improve the performance of these features, including the construction of a multi-stage pre-amp system, with analysis of frequency dependent phase and amplitude response.

##### [_A Versatile Equalization Circuit for Increasing Seismometer Velocity Response Below the Natural Frequency_](VersitileEqualizationCircuitBelowNatural_Roberts_1989.pdf)
**Roberts, Peter M.**

This paper discussed the development of an equalization circuit which has an inverse amplitude response to the &omega;^2 rolloff observed in the low frequency response of a seismometer in order to generate a more flat (and amplified for measurement) response in the range below the natural frequency
